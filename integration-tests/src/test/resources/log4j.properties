##
## This configuration supports capturing logging from within the library,
## while still allowing unit tests to report their own logging to the console
##
## To capture, you must find the "testAppender" and set its writer to a
## test-local StringWriter.
##
## To log to the console, you must use a logger name that isn't captured. For
## example, "TEST-com.kdgregory.aws.utils.package.Class".
